#BramPI

The BramPI project is inspirired by the [TimeLapse VIEW](https://github.com/timelapseplus/VIEW). The aim of this project is to run similar functionality (timelapse, bulp photography, bulp ramping) on a simple device (preferably a Raspberry PI). The device is to be controlled via a mobile app/website. In the case of the Raspberry PI, it could easily run a wireless base station.

## Current status
Currently no functionality is actually implemented. The repository holds a bunch of small tests that should later be combined into a real project.


## Environment
Currently, the code is being developed on Debian Stretch. The code is NOT tested on rasbian (yet).

To get an environment up and running to build this software:
``
apt-get install build-essential make libh2o-dev
``
libh2o-dev comes from stretch-backports.
