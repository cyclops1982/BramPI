The idea is based on others:
	- Timelapse+'s new VIEW
	- rpi-timelaps (see repro)
		This is a simple script that has a list of camera modes. It captures a image, downloads it, analysis it with identity %mean and then - based on that, goes up or down in the list of camera modes.
		According to a lot of others, this creates flicker.


Some notes:
- We can get Luminacance and/or Mean to see if a picture is correctly exposed.
- We can calculate the EV value (and thus use the light meter of the camera) to figure out how dark it really is.
- Based on EV, we should be able to know how far we are in the process
- The problem is that at some point, we want to not expose correctly anymore and just expose it to a certain area. This has to do with the fact that sunset and/or night sky is not a correct exposure, it's actually underexpose.


To figure out:
- What is the shortest shutter speed we can do with bulb mode on gphoto
- To figure out what EV values we have at sunset and at night sky (including no moon to full moon)


Main problems to solve:
	- I only want to do shutter speed and ISO changes, not appenture.
		- If we raise shutter speed, then we can leave iso alone
		- If we raise iso, then we need to leave shutter speed alone.




Technical notes:
- To get the newly libgphoto correctly recognized, use: export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/cyclops/dev/BramPI/libgphoto2/lib/pkgconfig/
- Bulb photo with gphoto: ./gphoto2/bin/gphoto2 --set-config eosremoterelease=5 --wait-event=500ms --set-config eosremoterelease=4
