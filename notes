The idea is based on others:
	- Timelapse+'s new VIEW
	- rpi-timelaps (see repro)
		This is a simple script that has a list of camera modes. It captures a image, downloads it, analysis it with identity %mean and then - based on that, goes up or down in the list of camera modes.
		According to a lot of others, this creates flicker.


Main problems to solve:
	- What is the algoritm to set the exposure?
		- Simple:
			If exposure/lum value is being lowered over X average photo's with a threshold, then raise exposure according to the config.
			This is what rpi-timelapse does
			The amount of photo's to use for the average & the threshold would be the algoritm parametes. It does means that we slowly catch-up on the brightness and would need some kind of maximum difference from the start...
		- Bulb mode changes
			Bulb should provide a way to do without flicker, but that also means that we need to understand *exactly* how to change the time & up the iso.

		- Analysis
			- Check if LUM or MEAN is the same for a camera-exposed picture, or if this is based on "what's in the photo"

	- How do we convert the different camera modes into something that we can change
	- Make sure bulb mode works well
		 ./gphoto2/bin/gphoto2 --set-config eosremoterelease=5 --wait-event=500ms --set-config eosremoterelease=4

	- I only want to do shutter speed and ISO changes, not appenture.
		- If we raise shutter speed, then we can leave iso alone
		- If we raise iso, then we need to leave shutter speed alone.
